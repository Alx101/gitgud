# GitGud

A small repo with branches and stuff to test some git commands.

The following will be tried out in this repo:

- `rebase`
- `cherry-pick`
- `rebase-onto`
- fixup commits

Here's the dev branch, we like information here.

It has been updated since the feature branch was created. This means a rebase is in order

## Good options to have

- `rerere`
- `autosquash`
